# Starknet AI Transaction Simulation

Welcome to the Starknet AI Transaction Simulation project! We have developed an AI-driven tool that transforms complex transaction simulation data into clear, concise, and user-friendly information, significantly enhancing the user experience on Starknet. By interpreting the raw output of transaction simulations and presenting the information in an understandable format, users can better understand what they are signing before sending transactions on-chain.

## Key Features

- **Plain Language Explanations**: Parses the technical details of the transaction simulation output and converts it into plain language explanations.
- **Key Information Highlights**: Highlights key information like the recipient address, the amount being sent, and any fees or limits associated with the transaction.
- **Transaction Summary**: Provides a summary of the overall purpose and impact of the transaction.
- **Discrepancy Detection**: Allows users to compare the simulation output to their intended action to catch any discrepancies.
- **Seamless Integration**: Integrates with Starknet wallets to seamlessly display the interpreted simulation data alongside the transaction signing process.

By reducing the complexity and increasing the transparency of the transaction signing process, this tool makes Starknet more accessible to a wider range of users. It aligns with Starknet's goals of providing a smoother user experience and enabling a broader range of use cases.

## Development and Integration

The tool can be developed as a standalone application or integrated directly into Starknet wallets and dApps. An AI-driven approach allows for intelligent parsing and summarization of the simulation data, going beyond simple templates to provide truly helpful and personalized information to each user.

## Importance for Starknet

As Starknet continues to scale and attract more mainstream adoption, user-friendly tools like this will be critical to onboarding the next wave of users. By making the core functionality of sending transactions more intuitive and understandable, the full power of Starknet can be unlocked for a much larger audience.

## Sponsors and Technologies

## Leveraging Nethermind's Starknet Infrastructure

To build a user-friendly transaction simulation and signing tool for Starknet, we can leverage the robust infrastructure provided by Nethermind, a leading blockchain research and software engineering company.

Nethermind operates the Voyager block explorer[1][4][5], which provides a comprehensive view into the Starknet network. Voyager offers features like contract verification, transaction analytics, and an RPC service[2] that developers can integrate into their applications.

By tapping into Nethermind's Starknet RPC service, our transaction simulation tool can reliably interact with the Starknet blockchain to fetch and interpret the details of pending transactions. Nethermind's RPC infrastructure is designed for high performance and reliability, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Harnessing AI Capabilities

To intelligently parse and summarize the technical transaction simulation data, we can integrate AI-powered capabilities from providers like Anthropic's Citrea and Anthropic's Spectral.

These advanced language models can analyze the raw simulation output, extract the key details, and present the information in plain language that is easy for users to understand. Features like highlighting important fields, providing contextual explanations, and flagging potential issues can greatly improve the user's ability to comprehend and validate the transaction before signing.

By combining Nethermind's robust Starknet infrastructure with state-of-the-art AI technology, we can create a truly user-friendly transaction simulation and signing tool that lowers the barrier to entry for Starknet users. This aligns with Starknet's goal of providing a smooth user experience and enabling broader adoption of the protocol.
